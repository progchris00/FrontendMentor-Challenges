## Overview

### The challenge

Build out this order summary card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Accessibility

### What I learned

In this project, I applied the knowledge I gained from my self learning journey. This includes using semantic html, applying best practices, improving accessibility, using flexbox, implementing different css selectors and taking note of the cascade. 

### Continued development

This is by far my second project on Frontend Mentor. So far, I am just applying plain HTML and CSS. In my future projects, I will try to implement other techniques like making my design responsive.

### Useful resources

Resources that helped me gain my knowledge
1. MDN web docs - my reference for syntax and usage.
2. Odin Project - course I am currently taking for learning web development.
3. freeCodeCamp - provide articles for specific topics.
4. Roadmap.sh - provides roadmap with articles and tutorials for different topics.
