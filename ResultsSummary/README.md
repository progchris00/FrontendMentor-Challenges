## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this results summary component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Accessibility
- Media Queries

### What I learned

In this project, I applied how to use media query and make my design responsive. I also practice other knowledge I have including accessibility, flexbox, and semantic html.

### Continued development

This is my third project on Frontend Mentor and I learned how to use media query. On my next projects, I will try to use grid and improve my skills on media query.

### Useful resources

Resources that helped me gain my knowledge
1. MDN web docs - my reference for syntax and usage.
2. Odin Project - course I am currently taking for learning web development.
3. freeCodeCamp - provide articles for specific topics.
4. Roadmap.sh - provides roadmap with articles and tutorials for different topics.
5. CS50W - where I learned about media queries.
